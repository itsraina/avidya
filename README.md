## Why was [`Avidya`](https://github.com/itsraina/avidya/README.md) named this way? What's the meaning behind it?

> Pronounced "uh-vid-yah" or ""avid-yah".
>
> `Avidya` is a transliteration of a sanskrit word meaning 'ignorance; the absence of knowledge'. This ultimately comes from Sanskrit `आवधा`.

`Avidya` is a combination of two words: `A` and `Vidya`.

`A` or `आ` means "absence of".
`Vidya` or `विद्या` means learned knowledge.

In yoga, `avidya` is often referred to as living with conviction that what is impermanent is permanent, or seeing ourselves as separate from the world.
